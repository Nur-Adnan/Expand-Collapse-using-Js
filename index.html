        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language for
        creating web pages. It is the foundation of web development and is used
        to describe the structure of web pages using markup. HTML elements are
        represented by tags, and these tags label pieces of content such as
        "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on.

        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. CSS defines
        how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other
        media. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once and
        is essential for responsive design.

        JavaScript is a programming language commonly used to create interactive
        effects within web browsers. It allows for dynamic content, such as
        updating data without refreshing the page, interactive forms,
        animations, and more. JavaScript can be used both on the client-side and
        server-side.
